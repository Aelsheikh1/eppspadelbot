# Firebase Configuration Files

This directory contains placeholder files for Firebase configuration. You'll need to replace these with your actual Firebase configuration files from the Firebase Console.

## Instructions

1. **Android Configuration**
   - Download `google-services.json` from Firebase Console
   - Place it in the `android/app/` directory

2. **iOS Configuration**
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` from Firebase Console
   - Place it in the `ios/App/App/` directory

## How to Get Firebase Configuration Files

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project (or create a new one if needed)
3. Add Android and iOS apps to your project
4. Follow the setup instructions to download the configuration files
5. Place the files in the appropriate directories as mentioned above

## Important Notes

- Keep these files secure and do not commit them to public repositories
- The files contain sensitive information including API keys
- You'll need to regenerate and replace these files if your Firebase project settings change
